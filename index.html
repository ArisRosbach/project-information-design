          <h1>Why Mozambique?</h1>
          <p>It is actually an interesting story since Mozambique possesses a very important raw material. Namely
            natural gas which was found in 2010.</p>
          <p>Gas and oil multinationals ENI from Italy and Anadarko from the U.S.A. made the discovery just off the
            coast of Cabo Delgado, Mozambique's northernmost province. The world's fourth largest offshore gas project.
            The discovery was worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
          <p>You would think that Mozambique would be very wealthy because of the discovery of the gas. The reality of
            today's Mozambique is that the country is suffering from a phenomenon known as the resource curse. This
            occurs when countries have large natural resources yet display little to no economic growth, increasing
            inequality, (armed) conflict and corruption.</p>
          <p>Mozambique's current government has been forced to implement budget cuts. It cannot pay its rapidly
            increasing national and foreign debt, and does not have access to the International Monetary Funds because
            of the 2 billion dollar in loans the country had kept secret. According to the Norwegian embassy's research
            team, Mozambique's current crisis is so closely related to the discovery of gas that it refers to it as a
            presource curse. One which manifests itself before a single drop of liquefied gas has been exported.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2>Why is that gas so important?</h2>
          <p>In 2021, 27 countries in the European Union alone consumed an enormous amount of gas. Gas is mainly used
            for power generation, residential heating and industrial processes. In the EU, more than 30% of households
            use gas alone to burn their homes. But as demand for gas rose, supplies dwindled. And where demand
            increases, prices increase.</p>
