            <h1>Mozambique's tax treaties</h1>
            <p>Mozambique, a country that probably does not immediately ring a bell, but in which a lot of the world is
              invested in. They are located on top of a gas bubble, which generates a lot of interest.</p>
            <p>But despite the great interest in Mozambique, they miss out on a lot of tax. Tax is more important than
              you think. Especially for a country that can put money to good use for their development.</p>

            <h1>Tax evasion vs Tax avoidance?</h1>
            <p>Before we start with the complicated story, it might be useful to know what the difference is between tax
              evasion and tax avoidance.</p>
            <div>
              <p>Tax evasion is the failure to (fully) comply with tax obligations. For example, by withholding
                information or providing incorrect information when filing a tax return. Tax evasion is illegal.</p>
              <p>Tax avoidance is done, for example, by setting up so-called letterbox companies. The weird thing is,
                this is legal. Later we will discuss these letterbox companies in more detail.</p>

            <h1>Tax treaties</h1>
            <p>Tax treaties can play a big part when it comes to less tax revenue. But what are tax treaties?</p>
            <p>Countries make mutual agreements in so-called tax treaties. These agreements are about taxing individuals
              and companies that invest and operate cross-border. The purpose is to agree on which government is going
              to tax where and when, and to exchange information between the two governments.</p>
            <p>A frequently cited reason for concluding them is an expected increase in investments between the two
              countries. Tax treaties encourage investment by reducing 'barriers' to economic traffic between the
              countries, such as levying withholding tax. However, lowering the withholding tax also results in less
              direct tax revenue for the signatory countries. </p>

            <h1>Tax havens & letterbox companies</h1>
            <p>Countries with a favorable tax climate are called tax havens. These are countries with a very favorable
              tax system, so you pay less tax on capital, income, and profit. Tax havens play a major role when it comes
              to tax avoidance.</p>
            <p>Tax avoidance is mainly done by letterbox companies. These are companies that are set up in tax havens to
              take advantage of this, but in fact, there is only a postal address or an empty office. The company is
              based in a country on paper, but no economic activities take place in that country.</p>
            <h2>Why is there so much fuss about tax havens?</h2>
            <p>Part of the profits of companies is funneled away to a letterbox company in a tax haven. As a result, the
              country where this profit was made misses out on tax revenue, because this tax is paid in the tax haven.

        <h1>Why Mozambique?</h1>
        <p>Mozambique possesses a very important raw material. Namely, natural gas which was found in 2010. Gas and oil
          multinationals ENI from Italy and Anadarko from the U.S.A. made the discovery just off the coast of Cabo
          Delgado, Mozambique's northernmost province. The discovery was worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>You would think that Mozambique would be very wealthy because of the discovery of gas. The reality of today's
          Mozambique is that the country is suffering from a phenomenon known as the presource curse. This occurs when
          countries have large natural resources, yet display little to no economic growth, as well as increasing
          inequality, (armed) conflicts, and corruption.</p>
        <p>According to the Norwegian embassy's research team, Mozambique's current crisis is so closely related to the
          discovery of gas that it refers to it as a presource curse. One which manifests itself before a single drop of
          liquefied gas has been exported.</p>
        <p>Mozambique's current government has been forced to implement budget cuts. It cannot pay its rapidly
          increasing debt and does not have access to the International Monetary Funds because the loans the country had
          kept secret. </p>

        <p>The first measure, PPT, is the most popular to be applied. The danger, however, is that such a test is very
          subjective. This can cause inconsistencies and uncertainties. SLOB is therefore the best one to apply for
          low-income countries.</p>
        <p>Of the current treaties in Mozambique, 2 contain the PPT measure, those with India and Ethiopia. This is a
          positive step, but in this way, Mozambique is not protected against the greatest abuse. The UAE and Mauritius
          have the two most problematic treaties and there are no further measures against them.</p>

                <p>Almost all of Mozambique's current treaties significantly reduce withholding tax rates for interest,
                  dividends, and royalties. Mozambique's government may renegotiate its worst tax treaties to include
                  higher withholding tax rates and improve other provisions that could limit Mozambique's taxable
                  deductions. If renegotiation fails, Mozambique could consider ending its most problematic tax
                  treaties, particularly those with the UAE and Mauritius. Termination has proven to be a successful
                  route to renegotiation for some countries and can be used as a tactic to gain favorable benefits, but
                  only if necessary.</p>
