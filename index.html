            <h1>Mozambique's tax treaties</h1>
            <p>Mozambique, a country that probably does not immediately ring a bell, but in which a lot of the world is
              invested in. They are located on top of a gas bubble, which generates a lot of interest.</p>
            <p>But despite the great interest in Mozambique, they miss out on a lot of tax. Tax is more important than
              you think. Especially for a country that can put money to good use for their development.</p>

        <h1>Why Mozambique?</h1>
        <p>Mozambique possesses a very important raw material. Namely, natural gas which was found in 2010. Gas and oil
          multinationals ENI from Italy and Anadarko from the U.S.A. made the discovery just off the coast of Cabo
          Delgado, Mozambique's northernmost province. The discovery was worth hundreds of billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>You would think that Mozambique would be very wealthy because of the discovery of gas. The reality of today's
          Mozambique is that the country is suffering from a phenomenon known as the presource curse. This occurs when
          countries have large natural resources, yet display little to no economic growth, as well as increasing
          inequality, (armed) conflicts, and corruption.</p>
        <p>According to the Norwegian embassy's research team, Mozambique's current crisis is so closely related to the
          discovery of gas that it refers to it as a presource curse. One which manifests itself before a single drop of
          liquefied gas has been exported.</p>
        <p>Mozambique's current government has been forced to implement budget cuts. It cannot pay its rapidly
          increasing debt and does not have access to the International Monetary Funds because the loans the country had
          kept secret. </p>

          <h1>How much is Mozambique losing?</h1>
          <p>Mozambique lost an estimated $1.4 billion over the years 2010-2020 in tax revenue through tax avoidance via
            treaty shopping. </p>
          <p>In this graph, you can see the total lost revenue per year. The discovery of gas fields happened in 2010,
            and since that moment you see an increase in the lost revenue per year.</p>

        <p>The first measure, PPT, is the most popular to be applied. The danger, however, is that such a test is very
          subjective. This can cause inconsistencies and uncertainties. SLOB is therefore the best one to apply for
          low-income countries.</p>
        <p>Of the current treaties in Mozambique, 2 contain the PPT measure, those with India and Ethiopia. This is a
          positive step, but in this way, Mozambique is not protected against the greatest abuse. The UAE and Mauritius
          have the two most problematic treaties and there are no further measures against them.</p>

                <h3>Renegotiate unfavorable tax treaties</h3>
                <p>Almost all of Mozambique's current treaties significantly reduce withholding tax rates for interest,
                  dividends, and royalties. Mozambique's government may renegotiate its worst tax treaties to include
                  higher withholding tax rates and improve other provisions that could limit Mozambique's taxable
                  deductions. If renegotiation fails, Mozambique could consider ending its most problematic tax
                  treaties, particularly those with the UAE and Mauritius. Termination has proven to be a successful
                  route to renegotiation for some countries and can be used as a tactic to gain favorable benefits, but
                  only if necessary.</p>
